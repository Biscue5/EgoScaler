Identify the start frame and end frame in a sequence of frames extracted from a first-person perspective video. Each frame is numbered.

Definitions:
- Interaction: The interaction is described in the action description and occurs between a hand and the given manipulated object.
- Start frame: The frame where the described interaction begins.
- End frame: The frame where the described interaction ends.

Hints:
- The sequence of frames may contain irrelevant frames, such as those showing only hand movements or other actions.
- Always ensure that the start frame number is less than the end frame number.
- If, throughout the video, the interaction is not properly captured (e.g., out of frame), then return invalid.
- If the manipulated object is not a rigid object, then return invalid.

Answer Format:
- Example: start frame: 5, end frame: 8
- If invalid, simply return: invalid
